🎲 Predictions Market - Revenue & Engagement Multiplier for Rugs.Fun

I've built a predictions market overlay for Rugs.Fun that creates a parallel betting ecosystem. 
Instead of just the main crash game, players can now makeside bets on round outcomes BEFORE each round start this dramatically increases

Revenue per round (2-5x more rake potential)
Player engagement (every round becomes bettable)
Session length (players stay longer to recover/compound)
User acquisition (predictions markets attract a different audience)

💰 How It Works (Player Perspective)

The Core Concept

When a round ends and before the next one starts, I have a betting window where I can place predictions on what will happen in the upcoming round. Think of it like prop bets in sports
I'm not playing the main game, I'm betting on the outcome.

Available Prediction Markets (24+ options)

Will it be an early rug (6-15 ticks)? *6.5x payout
Will it grind to mid-game (61-100 ticks)? *2.4x payout
Will it moon shot (300+ ticks)? *15x payout
