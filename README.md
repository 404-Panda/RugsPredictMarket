I've built a predictions market overlay for Rugs.Fun that creates a parallel betting ecosystem. Instead of just the main crash game, players can now make side bets on round outcomes **BEFORE each round starts** — this dramatically increases:

- **Revenue per round** (2–5x more rake potential)
- **Player engagement** (every round becomes bettable)
- **Session length** (players stay longer to recover/compound)
- **User acquisition** (predictions markets attract a different audience)

## 💰 How It Works (Player Perspective)

### The Core Concept

When a round ends and before the next one starts, I have a betting window where I can place predictions on what will happen in the upcoming round. Think of it like prop bets in sports — I'm not playing the main game, I'm betting on the outcome.

## 🎯 Available Prediction Markets (24+ options)

### ⏱️ Timing Predictions

- Will it instant rug (0–5 ticks)? **12x payout**
- Will it be an early rug (6–15 ticks)? **6.5x payout**
- Will it grind to mid-game (61–100 ticks)? **2.4x payout**
- Will it moon shot (300+ ticks)? **15x payout**

### 📊 Multiplier Predictions

- Will the peak be under 1.5x? **8x payout**
- Will it hit 2.5x–4x range? **2.8x payout**
- Will it reach 12x–20x? **5.5x payout**
- Will it go legendary (1000x+)? **50x payout**

### 🧩 Combo Predictions

- Quick profit (fast round, decent multiplier)? **5.5x**
- Patience pays (long round, high multiplier)? **12x**
- Grinder death (stays low whole time)? **7x**

*Rates subject to house calculations ofc!*
